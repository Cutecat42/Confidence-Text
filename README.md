# Confidence-Text

This uses the Twilio API and Heroku Scheduler to automatically send a text to myself every morning with a random inspirational text from my database. I can also go to the homepage of my Heroku app to send myself a text. I will not provide the Heroku app here, as it does cost money per text sent.

## Installation

```sh
npm install 
```

Please note: You will need your own Twilio API credentials if you wish to try this out yourself.
